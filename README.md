# neo-dash-preview

### HTML based gallery straight from sketch document.

This is an alternative for sketch mirror, provides 2x scaled images out of the box for retina displays, images in the preview are always fit to width of the browser and fill up the screen, so it looks more like the real thing. This also allows scrolling for vertical oriented web-page/website designs.

### How to install

1. Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/alanfraneo/sketch-neo-preview/releases)

2. Extract it.

3. Run the `NeoDashPreview.sketchplugin` by double clicking it.

That's it, the plugin will be installed and available under the plugins menu in Sketch.

### Features

Export all artboards from current page to a gallery using keyboard shortcut `cmd` + `shift` + `,`

Export all artboards from all pages to a gallery using keyboard shortcut `cmd` + `shift` + `.` - by default export will exclude `Symbols` & `Styles` pages. Also for convenience excludes any page starting with an `_`. For example: If I don't want to export a page for prototype preview like icons page, I'll add an underscore to exclude it.

The default scaling for above commands will be taken from the artboards' top most export configuration, If an artboard is not marked for export, it will be skipped.
